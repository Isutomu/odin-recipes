      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package crawfish tail meat</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>chopped green onion</li>
      <li>2 (16.3 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuit dough, separated</li>
      <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste</li>
      <li>cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <li>Mix crawfish meat, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, and green onion together in a big bowl.</li>
      <li>Flatten and stretch out 12 biscuits with your hands or a rolling pin until they are rectangular in shape and about 4x5 inches.</li>
      <li>Place a scoop of the crawfish mix in the middle of each flattened biscuit and close all sides around it, working with your hands until all creases are fully sealed and you reach a desired shape.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Place beignets carefully into the hot oil and fry until they float to the top and are golden brown on both sides, flipping as needed, about 5 minutes total. Remove from oil onto a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle tops with paprika and cayenne pepper.</li>
